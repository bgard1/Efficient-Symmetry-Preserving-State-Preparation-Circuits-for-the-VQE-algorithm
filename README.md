# Efficient-Symmetry-Preserving-State-Preparation-Circuits-for-the-VQE-algorithm
Mathematica code which can be used to reproduce the results in our paper: Efficient Symmetry-Preserving State Preparation Circuits for the VariationalQuantum Eigensolver Algorithm

This notebook contains example cases of efficient circuits that span a chosen number and spin subspace. All examples contained in the referenced paper can be generated with this notebook (with only minor modifications).
